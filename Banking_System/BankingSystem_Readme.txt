This Python script implements a simple Bank class to manage basic banking operations. When instantiated, it prompts the user to set a PIN and displays a menu for further actions. The user can change the PIN, deposit money, withdraw money, and check the account balance. Each transaction requires PIN validation for security. The menu() function facilitates navigation through the various options. Key methods include changePin(), deposit(), withdraw(), checkBalance(), and pinValidation(). The balance is stored privately and can only be accessed or modified through the provided methods ensuring encapsulation and security.
